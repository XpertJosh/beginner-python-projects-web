                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <p>The following is a list of tips that will be useful for beginners: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't be afraid to search answers on the internet:</span><br>
                        When coding, the majority of your time is often spent thinking of a solution to solve a problem, <br>
                        not writing the code to solve the problem. Not even professional programmers remember everything <br>
                        they need to know. Don't be afraid to look up how to do something or what something does. <br>
                        A popular site for answers is StackOverflow, which can be found on the <a href="/resources/">resources page</a>.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Read documentation & reference sites:</span><br>
                        Reference and documentation sites are sites that contain information necessary to code for the <br>
                        languages or services they are made for. An example of a reference site is W3Schools, which <br>
                        contains lots of information about many languages (including python). Some reference or <br>
                        documentation sites also have tutorials, such as W3Schools. Some reference sites can be <br>
                        found at the <a href="/resources/">resources page</a>. <br>
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Try creating your own solutions:</span><br>
                        When you are writing code for a project, try creating your own solution before you look up how to <br>
                        accomplish something. This is because you will learn more by coding a solution you created compared <br>
                        to coding a solution you found online. This said, don't be afraid to look up a solution, as long as you <br>
                        have already tried creating your own solution. <br>
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't get stuck in tutorial hell:</span><br>
                        Tutorial hell is when a beginner programmer only follows tutorials, and as such doesn't learn how to <br>
                        code themselves, but rather how to follow a tutorial. While tutorials are useful, they shouldn't be <br>
                        overused. For a more detailed explanation of what it is and how to avoid it, click <a href="/resources/topics/tutorials">here</a>.<br>
